# Force the inclusion of Busybox in the initramfs.

# Workaround for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/initramfs-tools/+bug/1661629
#
# When building an initrd with MODULES=dep, which ubuntu tries to do when
# installing kdump-tools, mkinitramfs tries to detect which modules are
# necessary based on the hardware and filesystem, and include only those
# moules in the image.
#
# However, the detection logic doesn't understand zfs on root, so building the
# initramfs fails. As a workaround, override MODULES to get mkinitramfs to just
# includes most modules without checking whether they are really needed. The
# result is a larger initrd image than is strictly necessary, but at least it is
# created successfully.
MODULES=most
