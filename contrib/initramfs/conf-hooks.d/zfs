# We initially set MODULES=most as a workaround for the following bug:
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/initramfs-tools/+bug/1661629
#
# Since then that bug has been fixed so ideally we'd want to use
# MODULES=dep or pass an explicit list of modules for the initramfs to
# keep it light (especially important for the crash kernel to not run
# out of memory and collect crash dumps consistently).
#
# Unfortunately there are 2 problems with doing any of the above:
#
# [1] When building the initramfs archive in appliance-build we are
#     doing so from a chroot environment under which MODULES=dep
#     cannot work as it is completely different from the bootstrap
#     system used for building the appliance. On the other hand,
#     avoiding chroot would make us look into the running kernel of
#     the bootstrap image for information which is also wrong.
#
# [2] Our appliance is used in multiple environments in on-premise
#     setups and the public cloud for which we use the appropriate
#     kernel variant (e.g. -aws, -azure, etc..). Making an explicit
#     module list for each of those would complicate our build. In
#     addition, that list wouldn't work around the fact that a customer
#     may decide to change their hardware on-prem or instance type on
#     the public cloud forcing the kernel to use different modules
#     than before.
#
# As a result of the above we maintain the MODULES=most workaround that
# includes most of the kernel modules on the system wihout checking if
# they are really needed. The result is a larger initrd image than is
# strictly necessary, but at least we can be confident that it is created
# sucessfully and should be functional under most scenarios.
